This project was for UNF EEL4744C, the microcontroller class in summer 2014. It is an example of the code the students
were to prepare for their project. They were tasked with working with a Maxim DS3234 RTC for the first time and told
to interface it with an 18F14K50 MCU. The 14K50 was new to them. They had worked the labs all semester with the 18F4580.
The project was to figure out how to program an RTC and display the "current" time on an LCD, down to the second. The LCD was a 4/8bit 
HD44780 controller based 16x2. The "current" time was defined by a digital wall clock in the lab.
